Phishing Check

### Description

If your domain is listed on a phishing blacklist, it has probably been misused for [phishing purposes] and reported to the list operator.

### Background

Criminals gain access to the website and deposit malicious code there. They copy known websites in order to obtain sensitive data such as passwords, credit card numbers and other personal data of the site visitors via these fake sites.

### Consequence

Your website has probably already been abused by criminals.

### Solution_Tips

If your domain was found in a phishing list:

**Take the website offline!**

It is possible for you to provide phishing content with the website and for criminals to collect personal information with it. It also prevents Google from removing your website from the index, which would cancel any positive ranking. This will also prevent your provider/host from blocking your website.

- Find out how and when strangers were able to access your domain.
Check your log files for unauthorized access from unknown source IP addresses. The time stamp of the manipulated or uploaded file could serve as the starting point for your search and give you an indication of the time of the attack and the so-called gateway.
- Change your access data!
- Web frontend (hosting contract, content management system)
- FTP, SSH accesses
- Database - use strong passwords
- Import a malware-free backup!
Delete all files on your webspace. This ensures that you do not take over any foreign files that the attackers use as "back doors" from the previously compromised environment. Before restoring, check whether your backup already contains the malicious code found by us and use an even older backup if necessary. If the backup is "malware-free", restore it and then update the system. Only then do you put the website online again.

- If you do not have a backup of your website, consider a complete new installation. Manual cleanups usually take much more time and should only be carried out by qualified personnel.
- Check your local computers for malware! On the website botfrei.de you will find help and programs. With the help of the DE-Cleaner you can clean your PC of different malware. (https://www.botfrei.de/de/eucleaner/index.html)
